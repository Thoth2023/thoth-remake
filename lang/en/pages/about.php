In Thoth 2.0, this functionality was reimplemented and enhanced through the integration of the Algolia API. The new approach leverages Algolia’s datasets to automatically suggest synonyms and related terms, making the construction of search strings more dynamic and semantically rich. This improvement significantly increases the coverage and precision of the search process, allowing researchers to build more effective and comprehensive queries directly within the system.',
